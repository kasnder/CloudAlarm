# Cloud Alarm
This application enables you to set alarm clocks through your browser.
To achieve this, this app creates a personal link that may be opened on
another device, such as your PC or Mac.

If your mobile phone is out of reach, just use your computer!

## Background
This project was created back in 2016 to ease my studies at university.
As I truly believe, that this application may be helpful for some, I have
decided upon publishing it on Google Play, alongside its source code.
If this app should change your life as well, leave a message.

Now, this application has been updated to support the latest Android
technologies, notably, Android O, FCM. As these are new to me, feedback
is appreciated.
